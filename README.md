ZDF News Scraper

to Do:
- make a Darkreader mode for the articleWindow using config libary to save options

- add last updated in newWindow (bottom left)?

- add refresh Button in newWindow

- generally make it more visually appealing

This Project works fine but doesn't look very good it's on hold right now I'm working on other Projects.
